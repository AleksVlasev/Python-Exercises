# Python Exercises

This is a repo for Python exercises that I work on while learning the ins and outs of Python. This is also a larger exercise in learning how to use Git and GitHub for version control. The point is for me to start small and build my way up to more challenging and complex projects. The first step is going through simple exercises before I can step up to some neat projects I have in mind.

##### Soft goals

1. Write clear and readable code that adheres to the PEP-8 standard.
2. Make sure to comment sufficiently but not too much in order to inrease the readability of the code
3. Obtain good habits in writing code (naming of variables and functions, flow of code)
4. Obtain good habits in using version control to aid my work.

##### Exercises

1. RationalNumbers - implementing a simple class for manipulating exact rational numbers. The goal here is to use objects in a simple way, writing methods for them and writing functions for combining such objects.
2. ExerciseHours - implementing a simple menu, using a dictionary, input/output from/to file.
3. RenamePDFs - script to automatically read pdf titles and rename the file using the title.
4. FizzExtended - just-for-fun implementation of a more general Fizz-Buzz-like procedure
